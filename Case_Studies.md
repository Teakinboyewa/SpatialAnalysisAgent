# Case Studies
The case studies demonstrate the capabilities of the Spatial Analysis Agent across three categories:

1. Tool Selection Capability: Showcases the agent's ability to identify and recommend the appropriate tool(s) for specific operations.
2. Code Generation Accuracy: Demonstrates the agent's proficiency in generating executable code to perform various spatial analysis tasks.
3. End-to-End Problem Solving: Evaluates the agent's ability to select the appropriate tool, generate the correct code, and successfully execute the complete operation.

## Level 1: Tool Selection Capability

## Level 2: Code Generation Accuracy
### Case: "Calculate the ruggedness index for Penssylvania, then summarize the ruggedness index value for each counties"

### Case: Perform the following tasks: 1) Count the fast food restaurants in each county and store the result in a new field named "Count". 2) Calculate the fast food accessibility score for each county as (Count / Population) * 1,000 and store the result in a new field named "Score". 3) Create a thematic map showing the fast food accessibility score for each county.Â

## Level 3: End-to-End Problem Solving

### Case: "Can you please generate a HTML report to show the building area for each building? You can look at the columns information, if no building area exists, please calculate yourself. Also make sure to use map projection when calculating area."
