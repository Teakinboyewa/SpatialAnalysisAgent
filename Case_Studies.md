# Case Studies
The case studies demonstrate the capabilities of the Spatial Analysis Agent across three categories:

1. Tool Selection Capability: Showcases the agent's ability to identify and recommend the appropriate tool(s) for specific operations.
2. Code Generation Accuracy: Demonstrates the agent's proficiency in generating executable code to perform various spatial analysis tasks.
3. End-to-End Problem Solving: Evaluates the agent's ability to select the appropriate tool, generate the correct code, and successfully execute the complete operation.

## Level 1: Tool Selection Capability

## Level 2: Code Generation Accuracy
Case: Calculate the ruggedness index for Penssylvania, then summarize the ruggedness index value for each Counties




## Level 3: End-to-End Problem Solving
