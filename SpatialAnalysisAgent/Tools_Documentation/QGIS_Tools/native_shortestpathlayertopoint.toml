parameters = """
INPUT: Vector layer representing network. Line vector layer representing the network to be covered. Type: [vector: line] 
STRATEGY: Path type to calculate. The type of path to calculate. One of: 0 — Shortest 1 — Fastest. Type: [enumeration] Default: 0 
START_POINTS: Vector layer with start points. Point vector layer whose features are used as startpoints of the routes. Type: [vector: point] 
END_POINT: End point (x, y). Point feature representing the end point of the routes. Type: [coordinates] 
OUTPUT: Shortest path. Specify the output line layer for the shortest paths.One of: Create Temporary Layer ( 
TEMPORARY_OUTPUT ) Save to File… Save to Geopackage… Save to Database Table… The file encoding can also be changed here.. Type: [vector: line] 
DIRECTION_FIELD: Direction field Optional. The field used to specify directions for the network edges. The values used in this field are specified with the threeparameters Value for forward direction , Value for backward direction and Value for both directions .Forward and reverse directions correspond to a one-way edge,“both directions” indicates a two-way edge.If a feature does not have a value in this field, or no fieldis set then the default direction setting (provided withthe Default direction parameter) is used.. Type: [tablefield: string] Default: 0.0 
VALUE_FORWARD: Value for forward direction Optional. Value set in the direction field to identify edges with aforward direction. Type: [string] Default: ‘’ (empty string) 
VALUE_BACKWARD: Value for backward direction Optional. Value set in the direction field to identify edges with abackward direction. Type: [string] Default: ‘’ (empty string) 
VALUE_BOTH: Value for both directions Optional. Value set in the direction field to identifybidirectional edges. Type: [string] Default: ‘’ (empty string) 
DEFAULT_DIRECTION: Default direction. If a feature has no value set in the direction field orif no direction field is set, then this direction valueis used. One of: 0 — Forward direction 1 — Backward direction 2 — Both directions. Type: [enumeration] Default: 2 
SPEED_FIELD: Speed field Optional. Field providing the speed value (in km/h ) for theedges of the network when looking for the fastest path. If a feature does not have a value in this field, orno field is set then the default speed value (providedwith the Default speed parameter) is used.. Type: [tablefield: string] 
DEFAULT_SPEED: Default speed (km/h). Value to use to calculate the travel time if no speedfield is provided for an edge. Type: [number] Default: 50.0 
TOLERANCE: Topology tolerance. Two lines with nodes closer than the specifiedtolerance are considered connected. Type: [number] Default: 0.0 outputs = 
OUTPUT: Shortest path. Line layer of the shortest or fastest pathfrom each of the start points to the end point. Type: [vector: line]
