LAYERS: Input layers. Input vector layers. The output spreadsheet will consist of a sheet,for each layer, that contains the attributes of this layer.. Type: [vector: any] [list] 
USE_ALIAS: Use field aliases as column headings. Use the field aliases from the attribute table for the spreadsheet.. Type: [boolean] Default: False 
FORMATTED_VALUES: Export formatted values instead of raw values. If True , exports the formatted, human readable values (e.g., from a value mapor value relation ) to the spreadsheet.. Type: [boolean] Default: False 
OVERWRITE: Overwrite existing spreadsheet. If the specified spreadsheet exists, setting this option to True will overwrite the existing spreadsheet.If this option is False and the spreadsheet exists, the layers will be appended as additional sheets.. Type: [boolean] Default: True 
OUTPUT: Destination spreadsheet. Output spreadsheet with a sheet for every layer. One of: Save to a Temporary File Save to Fileâ€¦. Type: [file] Default: [Save to temporary file] outputs = 
OUTPUT: Destination spreadsheet. Spreadsheet with a sheet for every layer.. Type: [file] 
OUTPUT_LAYERS: Layers within spreadsheet. The list of sheets added to the spreadsheet.. Type: [list]
