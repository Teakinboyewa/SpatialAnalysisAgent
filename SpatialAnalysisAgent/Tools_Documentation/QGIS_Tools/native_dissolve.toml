full_description = """Takes a vector layer and combines its features into new features. One or more attributes can be specified to dissolve features belonging to the same class (having the same value for the specified attributes), alternatively all features can be dissolved to a single feature.
All output geometries will be converted to multi geometries. In case the input is a polygon layer, common boundaries of adjacent polygons being dissolved will get erased. If enabled, the optional “Keep disjoint features separate” setting will cause features and parts that do not overlap or touch to be exported as separate features (instead of parts of a single multipart feature).
The resulting attribute table will have the same fields as the input layer. The values in the output layer’s fields are the ones of the first input feature that happens to be processed.
