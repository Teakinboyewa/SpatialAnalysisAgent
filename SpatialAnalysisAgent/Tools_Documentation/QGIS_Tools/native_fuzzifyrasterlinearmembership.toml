brief_description = """Transforms an input raster to a fuzzified raster by assigning a membership value to each pixel, using a Linear membership function. Membership values range from 0 to 1. In the fuzzified raster, a value of 0 implies no membership of the defined fuzzy set, whereas a value of 1 means full membership. The linear function is defined as , where a is the low bound and b the high bound. This equation assigns membership values using a linear transformation for pixel values between the low and high bounds. Pixels values smaller than the low bound are given 0 membership whereas pixel values greater than the high bound are given 1 membership."""
