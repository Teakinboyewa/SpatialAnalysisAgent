An overlay layer can also be used, in which case features from each layer are split at their overlap with features from the other one, creating a layer containing all the portions from both input and overlay layers. Features on the same layer will not split each other. The attribute table of the union layer is filled with attribute values from the respective original layer for non-overlapping features, and attribute values from both layers for overlapping features.

OVERLAY: Overlay layer Optional. Layer that will be combined to the first one.Ideally the geometry type should be the same as input layer.. Type: [vector: any]
