brief_description = """Outputs a single-band raster with values computed from the elevation. Roughness is the degree of irregularity of the surface. It’s calculated by the largest inter-cell difference of a central pixel and its surrounding cell. The determination of the roughness plays a role in the analysis of terrain elevation data, it’s useful for calculations of the river morphology, in climatology and physical geography in general."""

INPUT: Input layer. Input elevation raster layer. Type: [raster] 
BAND: Band number. The number of the band to use as elevation. Type: [raster band] Default: 1 
COMPUTE_EDGES: Compute edges. Generates edges from the elevation raster. Type: [boolean] Default: False 
OUTPUT: Roughness. Specify the output raster layer. One of: Save to a Temporary File Save to File…. Type: [raster] Default: [Save to temporary file] 
OPTIONS: Additional creation options Optional. For adding one or more creation options that control theraster to be created (colors, block size, filecompression…).For convenience, you can rely on predefined profiles (see GDAL driver options section ).
