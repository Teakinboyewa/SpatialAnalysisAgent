full_description = """Takes a vector layer and generates a point layer with points representing specific vertices in the input geometries.
For instance, this algorithm can be used to extract the first or last vertices in the geometry. The attributes associated to each point are the same ones associated to the feature that the vertex belongs to.
The vertex indices parameter accepts a comma separated string specifying the indices of the vertices to extract. The first vertex corresponds to an index of 0, the second vertex has an index of 1, etc. Negative indices can be used to find vertices at the end of the geometry, e.g., an index of -1 corresponds to the last vertex, -2 corresponds to the second last vertex, etc.
Additional fields are added to the vertices indicating the specific vertex position (e.g., 0, -1, etc), the original vertex index, the vertex’s part and its index within the part (as well as its ring for polygons), distance along the original geometry and bisector angle of vertex for the original geometry.
Allows features in-place modification of point features"""
