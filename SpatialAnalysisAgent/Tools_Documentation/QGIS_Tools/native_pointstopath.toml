Points can be grouped by a field or an expression to distinguish line features.
In addition to the line vector layer, a text file is output that describes the resulting line as a start point and a sequence of bearings / directions (relative to azimuth) and distances."""
parameters = """
INPUT: Input point layer. Input point vector layer. Type: [vector: point] 
CLOSE_PATH: Create closed paths. If checked, the first and last points of the line will be connectedand close the generated path. Type: [boolean] Default: False 
ORDER_EXPRESSION: Order expression Optional. Field or expression providing the order to connect the points in the path.If not set, the feature 
ID ( $id ) is used.. Type: [expression] 
NATURAL_SORT: Sort text containing numbers naturally Optional. If checked, naturally sorts the features based on the provided expression(i.e., ‘a9’ < ‘a10’).. Type: [boolean] Default: False 
GROUP_EXPRESSION: Path group expression Optional. Point features of the same value in the field or expression will begrouped in the same line.If not set, a single path is drawn with all the input points.. Type: [expression] 
OUTPUT: Paths. Specify the line vector layer of the path. One of: Create Temporary Layer ( 
TEMPORARY_OUTPUT ) Save to File… Save to Geopackage… Save to Database Table… The file encoding can also be changed here.. Type: [vector: line] Default: [Create temporary layer] 
OUTPUT_TEXT_DIR: Directory for text output Optional. Specify the directory that will contain the descriptionfiles of points and paths. One of: Skip Output Save to a Temporary Directory Save to Directory. Type: [folder] Default: [Skip output] outputs = 
OUTPUT: Paths. Line vector layer of the path. Type: [vector: line] 
OUTPUT_TEXT_DIR: Directory for text output. Directory containing description files of points and paths. Type: [folder]
