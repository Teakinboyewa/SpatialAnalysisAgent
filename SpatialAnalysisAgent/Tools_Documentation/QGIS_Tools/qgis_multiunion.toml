Multiple overlay layers can also be used, in which case features from each layer are split at their overlap with features from all other layers, creating a layer containing all the portions from both input and overlay layers. Features on the same layer will not split each other. The attribute table of the Union layer is filled with attribute values from the respective original layer for non-overlapping features, and attribute values from overlay layers for overlapping features."""
