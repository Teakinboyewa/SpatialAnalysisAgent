brief_description = """Transforms an input raster to a fuzzified raster by assigning a membership value to each pixel, using a Near membership function. Membership values range from 0 to 1. In the fuzzified raster, a value of 0 implies no membership of the defined fuzzy set, whereas a value of 1 means full membership. The near membership function is defined as , where f1 is the spread and f2 the midpoint."""
